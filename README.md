# Twitter Widgets
Unfortunately, Twitter doesn't have much support for making twitter feeds dynamic because it requires manually creating widget ID's and factoring the code to fit within a template.

I use python, mechanize, flask and jinja. This was one of my first attempts, so code is unclean and stylistically janky. I hope to make changes soon.
